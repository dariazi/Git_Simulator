# Git_Simulator
A console program meant to simulate all github functionalities

Deployment:
To run the program first download all 5 .jar files and the MAGIT.bat file. Save them in the same library. 
Double click the MAGIT.bat file. 
Alternatively, instead of running the .bat, open the command line and navigate to the directory that ontains the jars. Type in the followng command :
java -jar ConsoleUI.jar

Menu functions:
The menu includes 14 different commands and possible manipulations, most of which are pretty self explanatory, and resemble the functionality of git.
The following commands differ from git/ are new additions: 
[2] Load XML- The system allows the user to load an XML file that(assuming it corresponds to the schema i have included in the project), represents a file system and created said file system in the specified directory. 
[4]List recent commit- show all files and folders found in the recent commit.  
[5]Presents the current state in of the working copy (changed/ deleted/ new files relative to the latest commit)
